-Is it ok to repeat the same HTML code needed for the structure of a page throughout the different pages of a website? Or is there a better way to treat repetitive code?

It is common and acceptable to repeat the same HTML code for the structure of a page throughout different pages of a website. In fact, this is a widely-used technique called "code duplication" and is often necessary to maintain consistency and ensure that the structure of each page remains the same.

However, repeating the same code across multiple pages can make your website's codebase less maintainable and increase the risk of errors. To avoid these issues, you can use various techniques to reduce the amount of repetitive code. Here are a few options:

Use server-side includes (SSI): Server-side includes allow you to insert common HTML code into multiple pages without duplicating the code itself. You can define a header or footer file that contains the repeated HTML code, and then use an SSI tag to include that file in each page that requires it.

Use a template engine: Many web frameworks and content management systems (CMS) use template engines to generate HTML code dynamically. With a template engine, you can define a set of reusable HTML templates that can be used to generate the final HTML code for each page.

Use a CSS framework: CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation provide pre-built HTML templates and styles that you can use to create consistent designs across multiple pages. By using a CSS framework, you can reduce the amount of repetitive code you need to write and ensure that your pages have a consistent look and feel.

Overall, while it is acceptable to repeat the same HTML code across multiple pages of a website, it's a good practice to explore ways to reduce repetitive code to make your codebase more maintainable and reduce the risk of errors.
